## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run deploy`
deploys script to github pages


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

If you receive `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` in the console, see the [serve command](#npm-run-serve)

### `npm run serve`

This is an alternative way to run the server locally if you were previously getting `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` in the console. Before running this command, install `serve` with `npm install serve`.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
